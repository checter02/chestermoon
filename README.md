The uniqueness of ChesterCoin.

The uniqueness of ChesterCoin is that holders receive a commission of 3% on sales. This is a kind of DeFi farming. You just don't need to block funds anywhere. Unlike DeFi - farming, the total amount of Chestercoins is only decreasing. As you remember, in general, Defi-farms have the total number of coins, but it only increases.

How the total supply decreases

This is due to the automatic burning of LP tokens. When selling, removes 8% of the commission. 3% is distributed among holders, 5% is automatically added to the liquidity pool and burned. This process can be seen here: https://bscscan.com/token/0xa4cce27a7404f4e80adb7f2b65ab5d1df07256f8

It's safe? Does the team have access to this LP?

It's safe. We don't have access to this LP. We have transferred ownership. ChesterCoin is 100% community owned.

Here is the proof of the transfer of ownership: https://bscscan.com/tx/0xe44df99e9dda90767b298e3e772094dbe1d196401a89ece945d78fca87f4662e#eventlog
